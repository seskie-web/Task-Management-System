# System Overview: 
The system allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks via a front-end which is linked to a RESTful API, users on the front-end do not have to be authenticated to perform the tasks (this is a simple system demonstrating CRUD functionality)

The front-end is written on
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Smarty Template
Backend
- Laravel REST API

The front-end sends requests to a backend service to perform crud functionalities

# To setup the project please follow instructions on the readme file from the two branches: 
- front-end branch and backend branch
